### Location sharing

 - [Google Maps](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/15437054?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) - Generally recommended by the community
 - Various chat applications support location sharing: 
     - [WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/480865177351335/?cms_platform=android)
     - [Telegram](https://telegram.org/blog/live-locations)
     - [iMessage](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/share-your-location-iph69b192bc2/ios)
     - Some users have reported issues with live location accuracy. Sending a single location (non-live) when asking location related questions may help with this.

## Rules that are not in the rulebook

Below, you can find several rules that aren't in the rulebook but are either mentioned in the show, or stated by a Jet Lag official on Reddit.

- You are allowed to censor any text in photos you send the seekers.
- If you are asked a photo question, and the seekers arrive in your hiding zone within 10/10/20 minutes of you taking the photo, you can pause the game until you are done taking the photo and can reposition to your intended final hiding spot. During a pause, the seekers can't move and the hide time clock is paused. This is to prevent the seekers from using a photo question to trap you in a suboptimal final hiding spot.
- If you randomize a thermometer, the seekers may be unable or unwilling to do the new thermometer. In this case, the new thermometer isn't considered asked, but you still get to draw the cards.
- Once the endgame has been triggered by the seekers being off transit in the hiding zone, the endgame stays active (and the hider can't move) until the hider is found. If the seekers enter the hiding zone without realizing and leave the zone again, the endgame still stays active. The hiders doesn't have to announce this fact unless asked a question that would require them to move.
- When answering the station name length matching question, you must also state if your station name is longer or shorter than theirs.
- Curse of the Right Turn only prevents you from turning left. It doesn't prevent you from walking straight at an intersection.
